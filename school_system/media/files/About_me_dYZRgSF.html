    <p>I am Sharon Akoth Oito,a student at AkiraChix.I was born in Homabay county a second born in a family
        of five.I enjoy reading novels during my free time and when am not reading a novel I am listening
        to music.I also enjoy poetry,and through it,I received certificates during my high school days. </p>
       
        <p>Growing up I wanted to do  education as a career;literature to be specific.I always admired the effort of my teachers
        back then for our future success.I wanted to teach children to be
        better people in the  society and to be able to achieve their dreams.As I grew up,things changed,and I
        realised that there was something I was missing.I wanted to get my purpose and luckily enough it did not take me
        long before I realised who I was.</p>
        <p>I was lucky to join AkiraChix which helped me realise my purpose in life,I joined
        the school and  it did not take me time to realise the path I wanted to follow.Reality dawned on me that
        I wanted to  be part and parcel of the evolving world,and what does that better if
        not technology!!.And here I am on a path of software developer as a career.
       </p>
     
       <p>I find family,health and long life learning as the most valuable qualities in my life and for my success.I hope to
        be one of the best female programmers in the near future and am working towards that.I hope to accomplish great
       projects in technology and create software that will help me solve the societal problems,and through this I will
      be able to give back to the society</p>
